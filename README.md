# Materialize-CSS-Blogger
Materialize CSS for Blogger websites.


Get entire materialize xml file, copy and paste into your html model.

Tips: Take care all your widgets. All of them will be removed. Keep a backup of your blogger or replace widgets to keep working, but, this layout have custom widgets, and another widgets may not work properly.

I huge recommend to use only with new blogger website, so you don't worry about your widgets in use.
